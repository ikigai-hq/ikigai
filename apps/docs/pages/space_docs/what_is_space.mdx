## What is space?

Ikigai uses the term "space" to refer to courses, classes, or tasks.
You can think of "space" as the largest folder or your class.
It contains content such as assignments, folders, and submissions.
It also manages members (students) who can access your space and complete assignments within it.

## Members

Currently, Ikigai only supports one space with one teacher/owner and many students.
We do not allow adding other teachers to the space, except the owner.
