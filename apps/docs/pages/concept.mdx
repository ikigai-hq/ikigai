# Core concept

## Space (Class / Course / Tasks)

Ikigai uses the term "space" to refer to courses, classes, or tasks.
You can think of it as a group of your assignments.
You can create as many spaces as you want.

## Assignment

Assignment is the core unit of Ikigai.
With Ikigai assignments, you can set up dynamic assignment content (like Notion or Google Docs) and
create flexible and complicated layouts such as language tests like IELTS, PTE, etc.

You can also embed the assignments into your website or LMS platform like Canvas LMS, Moodle, etc.

## Submission

Submission is the work of a student for an assignment.
Students can attempt submissions multiple times, depending on the assignment's configuration.

## Pages

This is the content part of assignment. An assignment can have multiple pages.
You can think of each page as a part of the assignment. For example, an IELTS Reading assignment might have three parts, which means it will have three pages.
Each page can have a flexible layout, such as a single layout or a split/double layout (2 columns).
This allows you to arrange your assignment with two parts in the same page viewâ€”one part/column for questions and one for answers (just as an example).
