# Installation

Ikigai provides multiple installation methods, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your preferences and needs.

## Before install

Installation means running all components of our `ikigai` architecture.
We highly recommend reviewing the documentation before proceeding with the installation.

## Which option is best for me?

### Ikigai Cloud (100% free)
Ideal for most individuals, especially educators.

Our cloud service is provided completely free of charge.
We utilize it for live demonstrations and to assist educators in quickly adopting our platform without the need for complex installation steps.
Our funding, sourced from community donations and free cloud service credits, covers the hosting expenses.
Therefore, we currently do not have any plans to charge for this service.

However, it's important to note that this option comes with certain limitations, particularly regarding shared resources.
This means that the maximum file upload size and page speed may vary depending on the usage at any given time, and we cannot guarantee optimal performance.
On the other hand, hosting Ikigai on your own server can enhance performance and remove these limitations.
If you require assistance with this, please don't hesitate to reach out.
You can join our [community](/community) or email us at hi@ikigai.li with the subject line `Technical consultant`. We're here to help!

### Self-hosting
This option necessitates technical proficiency to manage your server or cloud infrastructure.
It offers a 100% free installation, with the only cost being the fee for your chosen server or cloud service (AWS, GG Cloud).

Perfect for developers, IT teams, and technical individuals, Ikigai offers a free 100% installation option on your chosen server (cloud or physical).
We strongly advise reviewing the Ikigai Architecture documentation before proceeding.

Should you require technical consultation, our community or email support at hi@ikigai.li are readily available resources for assistance.
