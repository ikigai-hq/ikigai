## Why we start `ikigai`

Hi everyone, I'm Rodgers, co-founder of ZenClass.
Over the past two years, we've been dedicated to using technology to empower educators and advance education online.
We've seen how difficult it can be for educators to use current complex and poorly designed UX assignment systems, or to navigate new assignment systems and onboard students without reusing data and their existing teaching flow.
It's clear that this process is too painful for educators.

We've decided to open up our core platform to the community to ensure we don't waste any time or resources.
Our goal is to focus on improving assignment flow, simplifying usage, and integrating seamlessly with your websites and LMS.
