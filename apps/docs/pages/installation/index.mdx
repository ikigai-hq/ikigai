# Installation

Ikigai provides multiple installation methods, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your preferences and needs.

## Before install

Installation means running all components of our `ikigai` architecture.
We highly recommend reviewing the documentation before proceeding with the installation.

If you encounter any difficulties or need assistance, feel free to join our [community](/community)â€”we're here to support you.

## Which option is best for me?

### Self-hosting
This option necessitates technical proficiency to manage your server or cloud infrastructure.
It offers a 100% free installation, with the only cost being the fee for your chosen server or cloud service (AWS, GG Cloud).

Perfect for developers, IT teams, and technical individuals, Ikigai offers a free 100% installation option on your chosen server (cloud or physical).
We strongly advise reviewing the Ikigai Architecture documentation before proceeding.

Should you require technical consultation, our community or email support at hi@ikigai.li are readily available resources for assistance.

#### Method 1: Ikigai Command Line (Coming soon)
TBD

#### [Method 2: Source Code](/installation/source_code)

### Ikigai Plus (Cloud service)
Ideal for most individuals, especially educators.

If you prefer not to handle the hosting yourself, we offer a managed service.
Simply email `hi@ikigai.li` with the subject line `"Cloud service"`.
We'll handle the rest, either internally or by collaborating with other businesses to ensure seamless management.

Our priority is to prioritize the Ikigai community first.
