This is the basic flow to use Ikigai.
You can create an assignment and embed it in your site or assign it to students via email.

## Step 1: Create assignment

You can click on the content list button on the left sidebar (highlighted in the red circle in the image below).
<Image src="/content_button.png" alt="Button" width={300} height={300} />

Then, click on the pencil button at the top of the list (highlighted in the red circle in the image below).
<Image src="/edit_content.png" alt="Button" width={300} height={300} />

Choose the "Assignment" option from the dropdown menu, and you're done.

## Step 2: Add Page & Content

You have just created an empty assignment with no content, questions, or quizzes.
To make it useful, you need to add pages and content.

### 2.1 Add Page

The first step to adding content to an assignment is to add a new [page](/concept#pages).
Basically, a page will have two simple layouts: a single layout, which is typical for regular assignments,
and a double layout, which is more complex but well-organized for language training assignments like IELTS, etc.

To create a page, click on the "New Page" button at the bottom of the assignment
and then choose the appropriate layout (single or double layout).
<Image src="/new_page.png" alt="Button" width={300} height={300} />

### 2.2 Add Content into Page

Now, you will have a new page or part of the assignment at the bottom of the assignment.
The page is similar to a Google Doc or Notion page.
You can use the editing tools at the top of the page to modify your assignment content. (Watch the video for more details.)

## Step 3: Assign to Students

After setting up the content successfully, you need to deliver it to your students.
Your students will receive a magic link in their email, which they can use to open and access the assignment without any additional steps.
