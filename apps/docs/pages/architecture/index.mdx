## Ikigai "Infrastructure"

"Infrastructure" refers to the foundational databases or third-party services upon which the Ikigai application is built.

### Postgres

Postgres, an open-source database software, is renowned for its maturity and reliability.
Ikigai relies on Postgres to store various user data such as emails, quizzes, documents, and more.

### Redis

Redis is an open-source data structure store that assists Ikigai in storing temporary data needed to execute complex logic, such as one-time passwords (OTPs), managing job queues, and etc.

### Storage (S3)

S3 assists Ikigai in storing various user files such as avatars, files within documents, assignments, and more.

### Mail Server (SMTP)

This component help your `ikigai` application send email. Basically, there are many free SMTP server
that you can use. Example:

- Gmail SMTP: https://kinsta.com/blog/gmail-smtp-server/
- Free SMTP servers list: https://mailtrap.io/blog/free-smtp-servers/

## Graphql Server

Our GraphQL server-side is crafted with `Rust`, `async-graphql`, and `diesel-rs`. It serves as the 'brain' of the Ikigai application, managing all the logic.
This component connects with the underlying infrastructure and provides the necessary functionalities.

It also empowers client applications to select the specific data they require without modify server logic.

## Client (Web app)

We use `Next.js`, `React.js`, and `TypeScript` to develop client web applications
It works well with modern browsers like Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.
