This is the basic flow to use Ikigai.
You can create an assignment and embed it in your site or assign it to students via email.

## Step 1: Create assignment

You can click on the content list button on the left sidebar (highlighted in the red circle in the image below).
<Image src="/content_button.png" alt="Button" width={300} height={300} />

Then, click on the pencil button at the top of the list (highlighted in the red circle in the image below).

Choose the "Assignment" option from the dropdown menu, and you're done.

## Step 2: Add Page & Content

You have just created an empty assignment with no content, questions, or quizzes.
To make it useful, you need to add pages and content.

### 2.1 Add Page

The first step to adding content to an assignment is to add a new [page](/concept#pages).
Basically, a page will have two simple layouts: a single layout, which is typical for regular assignments,
and a double layout, which is more complex but well-organized for language training assignments like IELTS, etc.

To create a page, click on the "New Page" button at the bottom of the assignment
and then choose the appropriate layout (single or double layout).
<Image src="/new_page.png" alt="Button" width={300} height={300} />

### 2.2 Add Content into Page

Now, you will have a new page or part of the assignment at the bottom of the assignment.
The page is similar to a Google Doc or Notion page.
You can use the editing tools at the top of the page to modify your assignment content. (Watch the video for more details.)

## Step 3: Assign to Students

After setting up the content successfully, you need to deliver it to your students.
Your students will receive a magic link in their email, which they can use to open and access the assignment without any additional steps.
