## Ikigai "Infrastructure"

"Infrastructure" refers to the foundational databases or third-party services upon which the Ikigai application is built.

### Postgres

Postgres, an open-source database software, is renowned for its maturity and reliability.
Ikigai relies on Postgres to store various user data such as emails, quizzes, documents, and more.

### Redis

Redis is an open-source data structure store that assists Ikigai in storing temporary data needed to execute complex logic, such as one-time passwords (OTPs), managing job queues, and etc.

### SeaweedFS

SeaweedFS assists Ikigai in storing various user files such as avatars, files within documents, assignments, and more.

### Agnostic SMTP Server

This component enables Ikigai to send emails using SMTP credentials, which can be configured to use services like Gmail SMTP or others.

## Graphql Server

Our GraphQL server-side is crafted with Rust, async-graphql, and diesel-rs. It serves as the 'brain' of the Ikigai application, managing all the logic.
This component connects with the underlying infrastructure and provides the necessary functionalities.

It also empowers client applications to select the specific data they require without modify server logic.

## Client (Web app)

This component is the user interface that users interact with via web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, etc.
